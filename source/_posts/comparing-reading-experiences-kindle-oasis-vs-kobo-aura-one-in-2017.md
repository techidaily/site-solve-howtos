Amazon and Kobo have released their new version high-end products: Kindle Oasis 2 and Kobo Aura One recently. As both eReaders are similar in quality (waterproof, frontlights and 300ppi e-ink screen) and price, many of you may be wondering which one is better. Let’s make the comparison of these two models by features so that you can figure out which one is your taste. 

![Kindle oasis vs Kobo screen](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/6-Oasis-Waterproof.png)

### Screen

| **Kindle Oasis 2** | 7-inch E Ink Carta display, 1680 × 1264 resolution 300ppi        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kobo Aura One**  | 7.8-inch Carta E Ink touchscreen, 1872 x 1404 resolution 300 ppi |

According to the parameters, Kobo Aura One has a bigger screen than Kindle Oasis, but the pixel density is the same (300ppi) which means that the accuracy of the characters and text on the screen will be the same on both eReaders. As the Kobo Aura one has footers and headers while Kindle Oasis does not, the display for these two models are almost the same in size. However, if you are in the full screen mode, the header and footer will go so that the shown text on the Kobo Aura One will be much more than on Kindle Oasis.

### Size & Weights

| **Kindle Oasis 2** | 194 grams/159 x 141 x 3.4-8.3 mm |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Kobo Aura One**  | 230 grams / 195 x 138 x 6.9 mm   |

Although the Kindle Oasis is almost 40g lighter than Kobo Aura One, there will be not much difference if you hold these two models on your hands. According to the picture, you can see that the Kindle Oasis has a unique asymmetric design that one side is 3.4mm and the other side is 8.3mm. What’s more, there are two dedicated page turn buttons on the frame. The thin and light ergonomic design will make you feel comfortable even after a few hours one hand holding. This asymmetric design will make the gravity point shifted as quickly as you move the eReader. What a wonderful design!

### Font & Layout

| **Kindle Oasis 2** | Fonts: 9 different fonts, bold control with 5 levels of bold settings, 14 font size                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kobo Aura One**  | Fonts: TypeGenius - 11 different fonts and over 50 font size with exclusive font weight and sharpness settings |

Although the Kindle recently has added more bold settings and fonts size options with all font types, but the Kobo Aura One still offers more options for font style and size. Both eReaders allow users to adjust the line spacing and margin. Some users have already noticed that there is a special reading mode on Kindle Oasis--the “landscape” reading mode which you will not find on Kobo Aura One.

### Front-light

| **Kindle Oasis 2** | 12 LEDs with auto adjusting light sensor                                                                          |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kobo Aura One**  | ComfortLight PRO-- Reduces blue-light exposure and protects your eyes for the best night-time reading experience. |

Different from Kindle Oasis’s 12LEDs, Kobo Aura one has 17 LEDs—9 white LEDs, and 8 more RGB LEDs for the night reading mode. Both eReaders offer the frontlights with an adjustable color tone based on surrounding lights. But there is a little difference which I think can be ignored. That is the Kindle frontlight will be more lighter and brighter in tone at the higher setting while more yellow at lower levels.

### Supported Format

| **Kindle Oasis 2** | Kindle Format 8 (AZW3), Kindle (AZW), TXT, PDF, unprotected MOBI, PRC natively; HTML DOC, DOCX, JPEG, GIF, PNG, PMP through conversion; Audible audio format (AAX). |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kobo Aura One**  | Adobe DRM, EPUB, EPUB3, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP, TIFF, TXT, HTML, RTF, CBZ, CBR                                                                              |

It seems the Amazon want to build its own digital ecosystem so almost all formats Kindle Oasis supported are Amazon exclusive. Good news is that you can convert the other formats to Kindle support format via [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/)—the best solution of DRM Removal as well as eBook Converter. In comparison, the Kobo Aura One supports much more formats than Kindle, even including the Manga formats CBZ and CBR.

### Wireless

| **Kindle Oasis 2** | Wifi or wifi+Free Cellular Connectivity(4G LTE connectivity in US where available, 3G/EDGE/GPRS in other locations) |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kobo Aura One**  | No                                                                                                                  |

The free Cellular connectivity is available on Kindle Oasis 32GB edition which is sell for $349.99 on US. Over expensive? Yes, but there are no monthly fees. Do you still think the price is too high now? 

### OverDrive Support

| **Kindle Oasis 2** | No                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| **Kobo Aura One**  | Built-in OverDrive |

As many libraries lend book through OverDrive on the US, so the built-OverDrive can save you a lot of money if you have a local library card. Although we can use Kindle Oasis to read the borrowed Over Drive Book, but the process to get the book will not proceed on the Kindle Oasis. A separate device is needed to borrow and check out the books. For more information about reading OverDrive books on Kindle, please read the article [How to Read Overdrive eBooks on Kindle Paperwhite?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

### Audiobook Support

| **Kindle Oasis 2** | Audiobooks from Audible.com |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **Kobo Aura One**  | No                          |

Supporting for audiobook listening can be considered as the biggest advantage of Kindle Oasis 2\. However, you will never find headphone jack on Kindle Oasis 2 so Bluetooth headphones are needed to listen to audiobooks.

### Price

| **Kindle Oasis 2** | 249.99$(8GB, includes special offer), 279.99$(32GB, with special offer) |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kobo Aura One**  | 229.99$(8GB), 279$(32GB)                                                |

Compare to Kobo Aura One, the Kindle Oasis does not have any price edge even in the special offer edition, not to mention the normal edition!

### Reading Managa & PDF

Manga books can be read on both Kindle Oasis and Kobo Aura One if they are purchased from the online eBooks store. Many of the downloaded free manga books are in CBZ or CBR format which can be read directly on Kobo Aura One, but are not supported by Kindle Oasis. But you can [convert the manga books to Mobi to read on Kindle Oasis](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). 

Although the Kobo Aura One has a bigger screen, but the page turning and refreshing speed is not as fast as Kindle Oasis’s. Another point should be mentioned is that “guided view” on Kindle Oasis. Thanks to this special design, you are easy to zoom in on a box of page and then go to the next box by pressing the screen. Can you imagine that you can go scroll through the pages of the manga to select the one that you are interested? You can achieve this on Kindle Oasis 2.

![read managa on kindle oasis](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/5-kindle-oasis-manga-reading.png)

As for PDF reading experience, I would choose Kindle Oasis 2 rather than Kobo Aura One. Why? I think the page refreshing speed and the landscape mode is the key point.

### Conclusion

As both eReaders are in their most advanced shapes now, it is very difficult to tell which one is better. But as for me, I would like to choose the Kindle Oasis as the landscape reading mode is amazing and the manga reading experience is better. What’s more, I listen to Audible audiobooks!
