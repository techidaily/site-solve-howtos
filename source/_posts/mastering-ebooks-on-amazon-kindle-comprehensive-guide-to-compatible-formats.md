### Kindle supported formats list

I have divided the kindle compatible formats into three parts: the ebook formats, document formats and audio formats. You can have a clear understanding about each part after scanning.

#### 1Kindle supported ebook formats

**1\. AZW**

AZW is the primary format which is used for ebooks you buy at Amazon's kindle store and can only be obtained from the Amazon web site. It's the preferred format to allow maximum readability on the kindle devices. Sometimes azw files are called KF7 (kindle format version 7) to distinguish them from KF8 (AZW3).

**2\. AZW3**

AZW3 is another name for KF8 and first came out for the kindle fire. It adds over 150 new formatting capabilities containing support for HTML5 and CSS3\. All the new capabilities include embedded fonts, drop caps and CSS selectors such as line spacing, alignment, justification, margin, color, style and border.

**3\. Mobi**

Mobi is a file format created by Mobipocket and now is used by MobiPocket Reader and Amazon Kindle readers. It can be read only if it contains no Digital Rights Management (DRM) protection.

**4\. PRC**

PRC files are used by the Mobipocket e-book-reader. Mobipocket ebooks can have either .prc or .mobi as their extension. Old MOBIs are always in .prc but the newer ones can be .prc or .mobi. DRM-free PRC format ebook can be read on kindle devices. 

**Tips:**[Difference Between Kindle Content AZW, AZW3, PRC, Mobi, Topaz](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)  

#### 2Kindle supported document formats

**They are**: TXT, PDF, HTML, DOC, JPEG, GIF, PNG and BMP.

Kinlde natively just supports two kinds of document formats. The first one is text file (TXT) and the other is Adobe's PDF format.

But there are also some available on kindle through conversion, such as HTML, DOC (a Microsoft Word file) and the graphic file formats JPEG, GIF, PNG and BMP. The conversion can be successfully and easily completed by sending a file to your kindle email address. If you need more information about how to convert files through kindle email address, please [click here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?ie=UTF8&nodeId=200767340&tag=neosk-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957#s2kemail).

#### 3Kindle supported audio formats

The kindle can play audio files. Music files in **MP3** format are compatible with kindle. Apart from this, audio books from Audible with the **AAX** and **AA** extensions are also supported by kindle.

### Kindle paperwhite and kindle fire supported formats

Your kindle paperwhite and kindle fire can't play every file. Only the files whose formats are compatible with your devices can be displayed on them. So make sure you have got the right file formats before you display them on your device.

#### **Kindle paperwhite supported file formats**

1\. Kindle paperwhite supported ebook formats: AZW, MOBI, PRC

2\. Kindle paperwhite supported document formats: TXT, PDF 

The above five file formats are natively readable on kindle paperwhite. If you want to read them, you just need to transfer the files to your kindle paperwhite. Note, the MOBI and PRC file should be DRM-free if you want to read them.

 When it comes to the audiobooks, the disadvantage of Kindle Paperwhite shows up because it does't support audio files.

#### **Kindle fire supported formats**

1\. Kindle fire ebook formats supported: Kindle fire supports all the common kindle ebook formats which are KF8 (AZW3), AZW, MOBI and PRC.

2\. Kindle fire supported Personal Documents files: TXT, PDF, DOC, DOCX

3\. Kindle fire supported audio formats: Dolby Digital (AC-3), Dolby Digital Plus (E-AC-3), non-DRM AAC, MP3, MIDI, PCM/WAVE, OGG, WAV

4\. As a kindle tablet, kindle fire also supports video formats: Flash, HTML5, MPEG4, 3GP, VP8 (.webm).

### Unsupported format: epub

The EPUB formats are most commonly adopted by many popular devices, such as iPad, nook, sony, kobo and Google. However, it's a pity that kindle devices don't support this common file format. But don't get disappointed. For you can get your problems solved by reading the following part. You can convert epub to azw or mobi if you intend to read epub files on your kindle successfully. 

For drm-free epub files, you can choose [calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/download) to convert epub to mobi and then transfer the converted files to your kindle devices.
