Audiobooks are the fastest growing segment in the digital publishing industry. While ebooks’ golden age has faded away, audiobook market is thriving. If you’re an audiobook lover, you must have heard of Audible.com – the world’s largest audiobook store. Well, audiobooks downloaded from Audible are in adh format. In this article, I’m going to illustrate what is adh file, how to download audiobooks on computer, and how to convert adh to mp3 format.

#### Updated 05/21/2021: The Audible has changed the way that you download Audible on Windows computer. Now if you click "Download" button on Audible library, you will get .aax audible file instead of .adh. This is much easier for users to download Audible books to your Windows. 

![download audible to windows](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/download-audible-windows-aax.png)

### What is adh format?

ADH is short for Audible Download Helper; it’s a downloaded Audible content. The **admhelper.adh** file is a protocol that assists the Audible Download Manager software in downloading your Audiobook(s) from Audible.com. It assists Audible Download Manager in taking all the pieces of your Audiobook file, pulling it from your My Library page, and importing it into either Audible Manager, iTunes, or Windows Media Player.

In the following table, you can find a list of file information that is associated with .adh extension.

| File Extension | Description             | MIME Type              | Open with                | Company       |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| .adh           | Audible Download Helper | application/aa-dhelper | Audible Download Manager | Audible, Inc. |

### How do I download audiobooks on my Windows?

#### Universal method applied to Windows 7/8/10:

Step 1\. [Download Audible Download Manager](http://download.audible.com/AM50/AudibleDM%5FiTunesSetup.exe) 

![audible-download-manager](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/2-audible-download-manager.png)

Step 2\. Configure your Audible Download Manager to import your audiobooks to [iTunes](http://audible.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a%5Fid/4655), [Windows Media Player](http://audible.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a%5Fid/4654),[AudibleManager](http://audible.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a%5Fid/4656).

Step 4\. Click “Download” button next to the audiobook title you want to download, then you’ll get an admhelper.adh file on your Windows. It’s a very small file, shaped like a white downward arrows in a green square background. You need to open this adh file with Audible Download Manager.

Step 5\. Audible Download Manager will open automatically and display the download progress of the audiobook. If the process is not initiated automatically, you can manually open the downloaded .adh file with Audible Download Manager, the complete audiobook will start to download.

![Audible-download](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/6-Audible-downloads.png)

The downloaded file transformed from the adh file is a complete audiobook which is in aa or aax format. After downloading the audiobook, you can play it in the player you chose to import the file to.

![aa-file](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/7-aa-file.png)

You can click "Downloads folder" button to check the path stores your downloaded audiobooks on your computer. Usually the path will be: C:\\Users\\username\\documents\\audible\\programs\\downloads

![downloads-location](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/15-downloads-location.png)

Updated 08/31/2020: Audible has released a new tool to help you download your audible books, that is [AudibleSync](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) and discontinued the support to Audible Download Manager from its official website.

#### Additional method dedicated to Windows 10:

On Windows 10 computer, you don’t need to go to Audible.com website from a web browser to download audiobooks. Instead, you can download audiobooks from Audible app available in Microsoft Store.

### How do I download audiobooks on my Mac?

Downloading an audiobook to a Mac is a piece of cake. It doesn’t require you to install Audible Download Manager.

Step 1\. Access Audible.com and login Audible with your Amazon account. Then go to your [Library Page](https://www.audible.com/lib) from an internet web browser on your Mac.

Step 2\. Click **Download** button next to the audiobook title you want to download, then the complete audiobook file will be downloaded directly.

Once the download is complete, you can find your audiobook in the Audiobooks section of iTunes. If this is the first time you want to play audiobooks on your Mac, you need to authorize your computer with your Audible account to activate your Mac.
