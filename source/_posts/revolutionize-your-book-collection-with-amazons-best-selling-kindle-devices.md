[Kindle for PC App Updating Automatially (without permission)](http://www.epubor.com/kindle-for-pc-app-updating-automatially-without-permission.html) \-- 10/24/2020 10:51:45 AM 

Hi Everyone, I've got a Kindle question I'm hoping someone can help with. I use the Kindle for PC app (Australia) to download books I buy so I can back them up. I have cleared the 'automatic update' box, but this morning it still updated without my permission. It will now not let me downgrade, and no matter which version of the app I download, when it is installed it is the current version 1.30\. I'm using Windows 10\.   
 I'm stuck, any suggestions?

[Kindle registration page stuck in eternal reload loop](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/20/2021 8:38:14 AM 

I have Windows 10\. I bought Epubor Ultimate. It told me I had to install an earlier version of the Kindle App. With Epubor's assitance, it downloaded and installed Kindle version 1.24.51068\. The app works fine UNTIL I go to register it with Amazon. It just loops the login screen over and over nonstop. The reload is so fast I can't even type a single letter.

 Suggestions? This software is useless to me unless I can get to my Kindle books I've purchased.
