If your Nook freezes, crashes, not responding or not works well, resetting is always the best choice to fix these problems. We can perform a soft reset and a factory reset to solve most of the common issues on Nook device. Following are the possible issues that can be fixed by resetting Nook: 

1. Nook device is unresponsive
2. Occasionally frozen
3. Locked up
4. Battery isn’t properly charging
5. Nook cannot connect to WiFi
6. Nook runs slowly
7. Forget Nook passcode
8. Just want to clear the device and start fresh

If your Nook device has such problem or you just want to reset it, please read further to learn how to reset Nook.

### The difference between basic reset and factory reset

As I have mentioned above, we can perform 2 kinds of reset to solve the issue on our Nook device. Before resetting Nook devices, we'd better learn the difference between the 2 types of reset ways.

**Nook soft reset:** A soft reset also known as reboot. It can usually solve most of the problems on Nook device. It's very easy to handle. Perform a soft reset will only restart your Nook device without deleting any data and content of your Nook.

**Nook factory reset:** Factory reset will turn your Nook device back to factory settings. This means after factory reset, it will act like the day you purchased it. The data and information of your Nook will also be erased.

But how can we reset Nook devices? Don't worry? You can learn the details about both basic reset and factory reset in next part.

### How to perform a soft reset 

Performing a soft reset is easy, simply follow the steps below to reset your Nook:

1. Press and hold the **Power** button for 20 seconds to turn the Nook off.
2. Press and hold the **Power** button for two seconds to turn it back on.

Usually your Nook device will function properly again. If it still continues unresponsive, you need to consider take other measures to fix the problem, such as a factory reset.

Before performing a factory reset, please be cautious and consider whether you really need or want to do it. If possible, back up the data to your computer before reverting to factory settings.

**Reset your Nook to factory settings will:**

1. Delete Nook contents on your device(You can redownload them from Nook library)
2. Delete personal contents that are not from B&N in the internal memory
3. Not delete personal content on a supplemental microSD card(You'd better remove the microSD card as appropriate)
4. Deletes all the metadata including bookmarks, highlights, notes and current reading position you have synced on your Nook
5. Resets settings to factory defaults

#### Perform a factory reset on Nook 1st Edition

1. Go to the **Home** screen, tap **Settings** from the **Home** menu
2. Go to **Devices** and select **Unregister Your Nook**
3. Click **Confirm** to unregister your Nook
4. Tap **Reset to factory settings** and select **Confirm** twice

After the reset process has finished, all the content, settings or any other data on your Nook will be deleted. It will be as it was the day you purchase it. 

#### Perform a factory reset on Nook Color/Nook Tablet/Nook HD(+)/Nook GlowLight

**If your Nook can turn on:**

1. Tap the **n** button
2. Select **Settings** from the quick navigation bar
3. Tap **Device Information/Info** in the settings menu
4. Click **Erase & Deregister Device**, tap **Reset Nook** to confirm

**If your Nook won't turn on:**

1. Power off your Nook device
2. Hold the **Power** button and the **Home** button **n** simultaneously
3. Release the buttons immediately after the **Read Forever** logo disappears
4. A prompt will appear and ask if you would like to perform the factory reset, tap Nook **Home** key to confirm.
5. Depress the Nook **Home** key again to start the process, your device will now begin the clearing process.

#### Perform a factory reset on a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook

1. Swipe downward with your finger from the top of your Nook screen
2. Tap the Settings icon and then click on the **General** option
3. Select **Backup and Restore** item
4. Click **Factory Data Reset** in the right panel
5. Tap **Reset Device** to start the process

 Once data has been cleared off the device, your Nook will reboot itself. Then you can register it again by following the on-screen prompt.

What if our Nook devices still don't work even though we have tried both soft reset and factory reset? In this situation, you'd better contact [Nook customer service](https://help.barnesandnoble.com/) for help. That's all I want to share with you. Hope this can help you.

can't get past network setup "Network Problem A network-related error occurred. You may have lost connectivity to the local wireless network. Press Continue and we'll try to test your connection." It accepts the wifi password, but won't keep going. I have a second nook HD+ that works......
