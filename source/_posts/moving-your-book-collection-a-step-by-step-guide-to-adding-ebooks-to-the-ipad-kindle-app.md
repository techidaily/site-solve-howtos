### Part 1: Transfer kindle books to iPad kindle app

Before buying any books from amazon, you should first register an account. Then your paid books will be showed up in the content of your Amazon store. Use your existing Amazon account e-mail address and password to register your kindle app. Log in and you will see the books you have purchased from Amazon. Click on them to download and they will sync to your kindle app automatically.

### Part 2: Transfer non-kindle books to iPad kindle app

This part is written for you if your books are purchased from non-kindle online ebook stores, such as Nook, Sony, Kobo, Google Play, etc. These non-kindle books are probably protected from their special DRMs. If you want to transfer them to your iPad kindle app, the first thing you should do is to remove their DRMs. Besides, you should make sure the file format is mobi which is permitted by kindle app. To solve these two problems, the [Ultimate converter--Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) may help you for it can one-click to decrypt eBooks purchased from Nook, Sony, Kobo, Google Play, Lulu and Smashwords online eBook stores in batch and can convert file format into epub, pdf and mobi.
