Kindle Fire has a 7 inch big display which is very suitable for watching videos. Like most people, I often use Kindle Fire to watch YouTube. But it's annoying that sometimes I have to wait for the online YouTube videos buffering. So I come up with the idea of downloading the videos to the Kindle Fire beforehand. In this way I can watch the YouTube videos immediately and don't need to wait any longer. 

This is a good idea but I quickly find it impossible as the YouTube doesn't provide any video downloading options – no matter you use the webpage YouTube or YouTube app. Fortunately I've found an app called _**FREEdi YouTube Downloader**_. You can use it to watch and download YouTube videos easily. Now let's start the tutorial.

1 Install FREEdi YouTube Downloader on Kindle Fire 

Open Kindle Fire App store and search "freedi". Choose "FREEdi YouTube Downloader" and purchase. Then it will be automatically installed on your Kindle Fire. If you don't want to use the App store, [click here](http://www.epubor.com/slideme.org/mobileapp/download/bdd30b4c-1c3b-11e1-a4b4-00505690390e.apk) to download the app directly then transfer it to Kindle Fire and install it with ES File Explorer.

2 Download YouTube videos 

Open **FREEdi YouTube Downloader** and you can see the latest videos in a list. The videos in FREEdi YouTube Downloader are as same as in YouTube. You can tap the menu button and choose "Channels" to watch different kinds of videos or you can directly search any video you like.

Long tap the video you want to watch and choose "**Download As Video**". The video will start downloading and you can see the downloading progress under the video description. You can also choose one more videos at once. The downloaded videos will show "Completed".

If you want to download high quality video, choose "Menu" – "Setting" and select "**Choose video formats**". Next time you choose "Download As Video", a window will pop up to let you select the video format (If the video uploader has provided different formats).

3 Manage and watch videos 

The downloaded videos can be found at "Menu" – "Downloaded". Just tap and watch them directly. You may find there is an ad floating on the screen. This is because FREEdi YouTube Downloader is a freeware. If you don't want to get annoyed by the ads, just watch the videos with Kindle Fire Gallery. Open Gallery at Apps and choose "MicroMacro-YouTube" then you can see all the downloaded YouTube videos.

The app does not work anymore. The creator refuses to acknowledge this fact and insists "it works fine". Read the reviews for yourself.

I use a Kindle Fire HD 8 and a PC laptop. I have the same buffering issues trying to watch YouTube videos on the PC. Currently, my Fire is broken (the charger port broke and fell out so no way to charge the Kindle) and I am going to order a Fire 10 to replace the Fire 8\. I plan to try the FREEdi upon getting the new Kindle as I have a terrible time with YouTube constantly buffering. Are there any tricks to bypass buffering from YouTube on my PC? Also, Im looking for info on how to view my Kindle videos/movies on my TV. I do not have a "Smart TV" or HD TV but I heard than with a few components, I could make it possible? What about a Play Station 3? I really cant afford a HD TV and Im not all that cracked up about having a Smart TV. Any input is much appreciated! Im not a tech savvy gal!
