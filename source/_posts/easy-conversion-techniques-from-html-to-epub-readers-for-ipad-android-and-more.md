This article is written for those people:

1\. You want to make or publish an ebook that can be widely used and read on multiple ebook readers.  
2\. You want to pull your html pages into an ePub file to read on iPad _instead of viewing them in your browser_.  
3\. You want to convert multiple html to epub with high quality and for free.  
4\. After the html to epub conversion, you want to share your own-made ePub eBooks with your friends or read it on overall eBook readers, such as Apple iPad, Sony Reader, Barnes&Noble Nook, Android tablet Nexus 7, Surface computer, etc.  
5\. More and more...  

This is just what I want to introduce in this article. Through my challenges and my friends' advice, here I want to recommend you convert html to epub using calibre.

Follow my guide and you will find that **converting html to epub calibre** can be as easy as pie.

### Step1: Downlaod Calibre

As Calibre is a famous ebook converter and ebook library manager, it can easily convert html ebooks to epub format. Besides, with this tool you can also convert html to pdf, convert html to text, [convert lit to epub](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/), and so on.

Firstly[download Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/download) and select a proper version for your PC. Here we select "Windows".

As the picture shows above, we can also convert html to epub mac and convert html to epub linux.

### Step2: Add html files to calibre

Open calibre, and then add your html files from your computer to its center zone. You will see your html files listed clearly. Then select the book you want to work with and then click "Convert books".

#### Tips:

If you want to **convert multiple html files in a specific order**, you have to creat a table of contents file. That is, another html file that contains links to all the other files in the desired order. Such a file looks like:

<html>  
<body>  
<h1>Table of Contents</h1>  
<p style="text-indent:0pt">  
<a href="file1.html">First File</a><br/>  
<a href="file2.html">Second File</a><br/>  
...  
</p>  
</body>  
</html>

### Step4: Open epub files

Click "Click to open", you will get your converted epub files as you like.

![click to open](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/click-to-open.jpg)

That's all there is to it. If you have any intention on self publishing, or you want to read your epub files on iPad or android, believe me epub is the best possible format for it's the accepted standard for publishers and conversion houses for digital book distribution and sales.

### Supplement you must know

1Convert html to epub Sigil

After trying calibre extensively, you can have a try to **convert html to epub sigil**. All you have to do is just throw your html files (it automatically imports images referenced by them) and add some metadata. Procedure is very easy, [download Sigil](http://code.google.com/p/sigil/downloads/list), then add your html files to sigil and save as epub. The key to the conversion is to remove everything but the main part of the chapter from the HTML files when adding html to sigl. Don't forget that.

2Read html on Kindle

Either calibre or sigil can only help you convert html to epub to read html on iPad, Nook, Kobo and more eReaders but except Kindle devices because Kindle's native foramt is mobi. So if you want to **read html on Kindle**, you have to convert your converted epub files to mobi with EPUB to MOBI Converter.
