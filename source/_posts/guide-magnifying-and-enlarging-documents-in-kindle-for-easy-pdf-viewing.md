Amazon's Kindle gives you a lot of flexibility when it comes to reading.

### **Step 1: Remove the DRM from PDF**

Install and run PDF DRM Removal for removing DRM from Adobe PDF.

View your newly created DRM-free pdf file with your favorite application (on whatever device you like).

### **Step 2: Zoom the PDF**

Use the directional arrow keys to position the box correctly and press the Enter key when finished. The zoom feature will now be activated and the selected part of the PDF document will be enlarged.

1 Turn on your Kindle by pushing the power switch on the bottom of the device. And select a PDF document to read in the menu of your Kindle e-reader by using the arrow keys on the Kindle keyboard. Then press the Aa button on the Kindle keyboard when the document you want to read is open.

This is my favorite feature of the new kindle software update. Prior to this, reading PDFs on a Kindle was at best an eye strain. Now you can press the font size adjustment button to the right of the space bar and it will show a menu with zoom options.

  
When you choose a zoom level, you get a magnifying glass cursor that you can move around the screen using the five-way button. Press in on the five-way button and you zoom in on your PDF.

hey,   
 this seems easier than other ways but did you pay for the program or used the free trial?  
 I downloaded the program but i can't edit or do anything with the free trial.

 thanks
