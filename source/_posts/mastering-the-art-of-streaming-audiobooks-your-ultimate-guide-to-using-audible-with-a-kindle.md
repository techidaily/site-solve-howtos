Thank you for sharing the tips, on 'How to listen to Audible on Kindle 1st/2nd Gen and Kindle DX' that really fixed my audiobook can't be playing issue on my Kindle Touch, I talked to four different tech support from Audible service people that no one can really fix my purchased audiobook from Amazon did not work on my Kindle Touch. 

 I have two Kindle devices, one is Oasis, one is Kindle Touch. I register them with my Amazon account and can see these devices within my Amazon account, somehow, I purchased one audiobook that can be play on Kindle Oasis but Kindle Touch. Thought I can download the audiobook in Kindle Touch but when I wanna play the book in Kindle Touch that it popup the Audible Activation Error msg: The audiobook you selected cannot be played because this Kindle has not been authorized. Please Tap Active and register with the Audible account used to purchase this audiobook. I try to follow the msg and active the device but it never works. like mentioned before, I talked to four different tech support from Audible service people that no one can really fix my purchased audiobook from Amazon did not work on my Kindle Touch. 

 With the solution to download Audible Manager on my PC and active my Kindle Touch device within my Amazon account, then download the audiobook again thru Audible Manger (even though I did see the audiobook on my device library already but it just not working..... &gt;&lt;) , wala, it works perfectly on my Kindle Touch now ^^y.

 one thing is different then your post, I can't add the book in my library to my Kindle Touch, assume it could be that audiobook already exist in my device thought 'active' steps might be the key to fix the issue.

  
 Thank you for sharing the tips, it helps!

This is just great. I bought a new Kindle Oasis to “upgrade” from my old one and come to find out there is no place to plug in headphones for audio books. That’s a great upgrade. Now I have to go buy a set of Bluetooth headphones?? You have a great racket going here.
