A significant advantage of eBook reading device is the capacity, even with a basic version of Kindle, you can hold thousands of eBooks with this handy size device. But every coin has two sides. As you keep adding more and more ebooks to your device, storage space will run out soon. What's worse, you need to spend a lot of time finding the book you want to read, it is high time that you should delete / remove kindle books.

**Kindle delete permanently vs remove from device:** In general, the difference between "Delete" and "Remove" is that "remove" only deleted the history for the book(we can retain them in the cloud for later), while "Delete" will delete books from the MYCD library. 

### Delete/Remove books on Kindle (Kindle Paperwhite, Voyage and Kindle Fire)

#### **General method to delete kindle books on Kindle** 

**Step 1.** On your kindle device, navigate to your Kindle library.

**Step 2\.** Press down on the cover of the book that you'd like to delete.

**Step 3\.** This will open a pop-up menu. Tap "Remove download". Your Kindle books will be removed from kindle device

#### Tip: How to redownload Kindle books to Amazon Kindle again?

Books are still stored on Amazon cloud though they were removed from your device. So it's possible to redownload them onto your device again. just click on "MY LIBRARY" on the home page. Then choose "ALL" button in the top-right corner, next select the book you wish to redownload.

Of course you can also re-download your Kindle books through your Amazon account. From "Manager your Content and Device" tab click the "Actions" button, select the "Deliver to Default Device or Others" option.

### Delete Kindle books in batch on Kindle device

Since 11 November, 2017, Amazon rolled out a new Firmware Update 5.9.2.0.1 for its Kindle ereaders, like Kindle Oasis 2 (KO2), Kindle Oasis (KO), Kindle Voyage (KV), Kindle (Kindle 7), Kindle (Kindle 8), Kindle Paperwhite 3 (KPW3) and Kindle Paperwhite 2 (KPW2), which allows you delete Kindle books in batch.

To delete Kindle books in batch, you need to go to **Home — Menu — Settings — Device Options — Advanced Options — Storage management — Manual Removal.** Then You can manage your device storage by choosing the items you would like to remove.

![manual removal](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/manual-removal.jpg)

Or you can also go to **Home — Menu — Settings — Device Options — Advanced Options — Storage management — Quick Archive** to quickly remove content from this device that has not been opened for the last 1/3/6 months, 1 year or more.

Amazon adds storage management to the new firmware, though it’s a small function, it’s really convenient for Kindle users who need to clean their storage frequently. Compared to Manual deletion, Quick Archive will easily your contents by accident. If you can’t remember all the contents in your kindle local disk, please don’t try this method.

**Notice:** All the methods above just delete the books from your device. If you want to delete them completely, you need to [remove them from Kindle Cloud](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

### Delete Kindle books by deregistering your device

When we want to re-sell our Kindle device, or the Kindle device is lost or stolen, the safest way to protect our contents is to deregister our device from Amazon.

Go to "Manage Your Content and Devices" page >>> select the "Your Device" tab. Then click on the grey button "Device Actions" >>> select "Deregister". 

![deregister kindle](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/deregister-kindle.jpg)

Please keep in mind that this will remove all the contents from your device. You are not able to download or buy any more until your device is registered with another Amazon account.

![deregister yes](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/deregister-yes.jpg)

### Delete books from Kindle Unlimited

With Kindle Unlimited we can borrow books (up to ten books) but no need to pay for them. But once finished reading, they will be still saved in our account. In this situation we can delete them from Kindle Unlimited history.

You just need to "View My Kindle Unlimited Library", and then "Return this book".

![return kindle books](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/return-kindle-book.jpg)

Tips: 

1\. Kindle Unlimited allows you to borrow 10 books at a time. So if you borrow more than 10 books, you will be asked to delete one in Kindle Unlimited library.

2\. Books will be gone when you cancel your Kindle Unlimited subscription.

### Delete books from Kindle Cloud: delete kindle books permanently

**Update:** If your Kindle firmware was updated to 5.12.5, there’s also the option to permanently delete purchased ebooks and personal documents from the Kindle itself. 

Before you do this, please make sure you understand that if you delete a book from your Kindle Cloud, you will not be able to read it any more unless you purchase the book again. In other words, you are giving up your ownership of this book by deleting it from your Kindle Cloud.

If you navigate to this part, I can see you really have a pretty strong mind to clean up your Kindle archives. **Now let's remove contents from Kindle Cloud permanently(deleted them off the website).**

1) Login to Amazon.com and go to **"Manage Your Content and Devices"** page. In this page you can see all the items in your Kindle Cloud, which means they can be synced to all your registered Kindle devices and apps.

2) Select the books you want to delete, and then click on "Delete" button.

![delete from kindle cloud](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/delete-from-kindle-cloud.png)

3) Then it will pop up a warning window, click "Yes".

![delete from kindle cloud warning](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/delete-from-kindle-cloud-warning.png)

 **Wrapped up:** 

If you delete books from your library/cloud/archive, you can never have the books back. This means that you have to purchase for a second time if you want to read them again. Still want to delete kindle books from your Kindle account but need a back-up? Please use [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) tool which helps remove the drm from your Kindle books and back up them to your computer for good.

### Delete Rented Kindle Books

For users borrowing ebooks from the library, typically, rented books are automatically returned to the library when the Kindle book lending period expires. However, the expired Kindle Books may still appear on your Kindle device or reading app, and they cannot be opened. To delete such Kindle books, please follow the steps below.

1 Go to "[Content & Device](https://www.amazon.com/hz/mycd/digital-console/contentlist/allcontent/dateDsc)" page on Amazon's website.

2 Select the book you want to delete, and click "Delete". In the prompted new window, choose "Yes, delete permanently".

![delete from expired rented library kindle books](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/delete-expired-rented-kindle-books.png)

Hi Susie,  
 If you keep a book on the device, and directly delete it in Kindle Library Management page, then the book on your device will not disappear. But if you delete a book on both device and Kindle Library Management page, you are not to able to download it again.

So to delete an item from both the cloud and the device, you need to delete it twice? In the article above it says if you delete from the cloud it will disappear from the device also.

And you also need to delete them on your device. And make sure you hadn't sync other contents.

 Delete books definitely won't take more space.

I really appreciate your doing this as my Kindle app on my iPad was getting kind of trashy/messy looking.   
 However, you may want to make a note of the following: as I was deleting titles from my device page I noticed that the dialogue box that popped up said something different than what you quote here. It said: "Delete Permanently" over "Add to Collection". As I was only deleting samples and one (horrid) book that I got by mistake I opted to click on Delete Permanently. You might want to check this out. It could be different post OS 7.  
 Again, thank you.

Hi,

 If the book is synced from your cloud library, then you will see "Remove from Devide".

 If the file doesn't exist in the cloud but just on your device, you will see "Delete permanently".

 However, I will explain this in the article. Thanks for your feedback.

Thank you for taking the time to write this. You'd think this was a silly thing to spend any time on at all; esp. since most people are at least partly computer savvy. Well, I'm pretty techno-literate and it was driving me NUTS that I could NOT find a way to quickly and intuitively delete a book from the Kindle App I downloaded to my iPad Air. Thank you for solving this so elegantly.

Now that Amazon has changed it's "Manage My Kindle" - how do you delete non-Amazon purchased books from the Kindle App on iPhones and iPads   
 Thank you

I just wanted to say thanks for this article! I had a ton of Loan Ended letters on my Kindle Paperwhite from when I get library ebooks from OverDrive. I could not figure out how to get rid of them! I'm so pleased to have all those annoying things gone!

It took a long time to remove from the device but it really does work. Thank you, there's been some books that I brought by accident that I couldn't delete off the cloud until today. This is definitely amazing.

Hi I am having a hard time to delete books from my cloud I did delete them from Manage content device but the icon is still in the cloud file, when I hold down the book the only option that comes up is adding to favourite or download no delete sign. Please help

I need to delete library borrowed books from iphone using Kindle app. They were returned on amazon site with MMC, but still on iphone cloud. Not on computer to remove again. When I hold down on iphone to delete from cloud, I do not get a remove or delete from device prompt. Only recommend, download, details, add to collections. I have read previous posts. Still can not remove from cloud. Suggestions?

Thanks so much for the help.I have 3 Kindle's and I have like 2 to3 thousand books on them and I could not figure out how to erase them. But with your help I am cleaning them up so I can add some more. I read a book in about 3-4 days. I love books and I love my Kindle's. Thanks so much.

I followed all directions posted on all of my devices and under the Manage My Content section on amazon but I STILL had the deleted book covers showing up on my kindle for PC app. When I left click it only gives me the option to purchase the book or to add it to a collection, which I don't sort my books by collection anyhow. I tried right clicking and then hitting the delete button. Nothing. Wiped all kindle books off my laptop and emptied the recycle bin. Still no change. This has been an issue for me for years literally. I had given up. I decided to google around for a solution today and still could not get the covers off my app. The PC app has changed over the years but currently under Library you see ALL and DOWNLOADED. I had removed all books from my laptop and so under downloaded I had 0 but under ALL I had 101\. I only actually own 41 kindle books. The rest are book covers from library ebooks I have checked out and have now expired and I have either used the return feature under manage my content or for expired books used the delete for ever option. STILL these books are on my PC kindle app.  
 FINALLY I stumbled upon a solution. The images are cached under the appdata file. I got all the 'ghost' content off my PC by deleting the cache file. Then I opened the app and re-synced.  
 SO step by step: 1\. Find your Kindle XML File named "KindleSyncMetadataCache.xml"  
 It will be located here (the default _location)_: C:\\Users\\YourUserName\\AppData\\Local\\Amazon\\Kindle\\Cache  
 "YourUserName" will be your username on your computer. 2\. Delete the file. It will regenerate when you next open and sync the kindle app. Now your PC kindle app will match whatever you have in the cloud.

Your solution in 2016, which I just found, was awesome and so simple. All I did, as you instructed was find the cache and delete that particular file only. It worked!   
 I've spent hours over the last few years trying to deal with this. Much appreciation.

I have the same problem with "ghost" icons on my Fire 8 HD tablet. I try to "hide" or "remove" and they disappear but after I use an application and come back to the home screen there they are again! Some are book covers of items I returned and some are just blank Kindle files. How do I permanently get rid of these phantom icons?
