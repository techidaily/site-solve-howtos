**Note**: As we have several articles about this topic and some of them have thin content, so we published an [all-in-one guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) about using [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) to handle different situation like you are using Kindle Touch/Paperwhite/Voyage or just Kindle Android app. So please just click the link above to read that article.

This article will not update anymore.

\=================================

Below is the original content.

**1\. Authorize your copy of Kindle for PC and "Sync and check for new items"** 

Install Kindle for PC and authorize your copy. Our software works with the new version of Kindle for PC perfectly.

**2\. Load Kindle eBooks**  
View the book in Kindle for PC. (in other words, make sure it is downloaded to your computer, not in “Archived Items”)

**3\. Run Epubor Ultimate to remove drm from kindle & Mobipokect Reader(azw, prc, mobi, topaz)**  
Run Epubor Ultimate, you'll see your downloaded kindle file display under kindle column. Just drag these files to the right blank window, voila, all your files will be decrypted immediately.

Hello,

 I just purchased epubor ultimate and I am disappointed by the fact that kindle azw3 files seem not supported.

 How can DRM be removed from the latter?  
 Thanks in advance for your help.

 Regards,

If I have a kindle e-book on my PC before I try this will I lose it if I try this or do I need to download first.

Hi, John

 Sorry for the inconvenience.

 For removing Kindle DRM:  
 Make sure all the books are synced by the same version of Kindle for PC (other than directly copied from your Kindle device or other sources) and you can read all the books on Kindle for PC!

 1, Download and authorize Kindle for PC with your Amazon ID;  
 2, Sync all books to PC, make sure you can read them;  
 3, Run Epubor software!

 For removing Kindle DRM:  
 Make sure all the books are synced by the same version of Kindle for PC (other than directly copied from your Kindle device or downloaded from Amazon Kindle's official site) and you can read all the books on Kindle for PC!

 1, Download and authorize Kindle for PC with your Amazon ID;  
 2, Launch Kindle for PC and it will auto sync all books to PC, make sure you can open and read them;

Look, I have tried this umpty times now with freshly downloaded books. IT DOES NOT WORK. Not able to downgrade Kindle for PC either, because Amazon forces upgrade to 1.30 despite checking the "do not upgrade" box. 

 I successfully used Apprentice Alf's software for years, but it has also tanked. At least they admit it. 

 Yep, super glad for the free trial. Thank you for that.

I have downloaded the appropriate epub removal for Mac. However, I can't work out how to actually get the books from Kindle into the programme to convert them. Can you advise where you have instructions to enable me to do this? Kindle is greyed out and I can't access the files for the actual books in Kindle anywhere to convert them.

Hi,

 Please click Help--&gt;Settings to set your Kindle eBook path, then the software will automatically detect and upload them.

 Thank you !

I am still unable to use this software. When I go into Kindle to follow your instructions from the link, there is no Tools &gt; Options &gt; Content. I can't go any further.

Everyone's so disappointed and noone seems to have been able to make it work. However the dude who answers the questions keeps giving it 5 stars and falsifies the ratings.
