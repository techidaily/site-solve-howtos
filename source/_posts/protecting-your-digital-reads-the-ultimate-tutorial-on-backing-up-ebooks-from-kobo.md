Except Amazon, Kobo is also one of the popular eBook retailers on the market. As an eBook lover, I guess you may have downloaded or purchased a large number of Kobo books and enjoyed them for a long time. But have you ever thought about the safety of your Kobo books? Do you worry about that someday your Kobo books will disappear without any notice? In fact, our downloaded Kobo books are not 100% safe, so it's necessary for us to back up Kobo books safely on our computer, so does books from other eBook vendors.Learn more about [back up books](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

### Why we need to back up Kobo books

As I have mentioned above, considering the safety of our Kobo books, back up our Kobo books is essential. You may have heard about the true story that Amazon delete one of its user's Kindle books without saying any word. In fact, Kobo, like other eBook stores keep your books in "Cloud", which means your books are saved on its server. We cannot guarantee Kobo won't delete our Kobo books someday like Amazon.

Besides, we cannot make sure Kobo eBook store will be in good running condition all the time either. We need to take measures to protect our books. If we back up Kobo books to computer, we need not to worry that we will lose them even Kobo store will shut down in the future. 

###  How to back up Kobo books

Have learned the reasons that we need to back up Kobo books, I guess you have no doubt to make backup of Kobo books? But how to? In fact, most of our downloaded Kobo books are DRM protected, removing DRM from Kobo books and then saved the copy of DRM free Kobo books on your computer drive is the best way. You may ask me cannot I just copy the DRMed files to another folder? Actually, if Kobo has delete your books, they may cannot be opened at all, because Kobo may tell the server that you are not the owner of these books. So the only step to back up your Kobo books is removing DRM.

In order to remove DRM from Kobo books, we need a powerful DRM removal tool to help us. But there are so many DRM removals on the market, which program is better? Here I prefer a professional tool [Ultimate eBook Converter--Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/)and want to share it with you. As far as I'm concerned, it's my favorite DRM removal software, which supports batch DRM decryption and eBook conversion. It can help us remove DRM from Kobo desktop or Kobo eReader directly. Besides, its process speed is very fast. Compared with other similar program, it's easier to use. You can download it for free trial.
