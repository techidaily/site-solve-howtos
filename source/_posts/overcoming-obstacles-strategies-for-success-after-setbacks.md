Hi,

 I purchased Epubor Vitalsource downloader. I was trying to convert a textbook into a pdf file, but it failed. There was a output file, in which there is a phrase "Please refresh your browser" with a picture of a robot on all pages. I tried many times, but all failed. Please let me know how to solve this problem.

 Thanks

[Unsupported DRM](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/16/2016 11:27:23 PM 

I download DRM removal for free trial and want to decrypt some EPUB files, when I drag them to the software, most of them are decrypted, but only the rest one failed and I get the error message "your book is protected by a kind of DRM we do not support". 

 It's strange. I can read all of them via Adobe Digital Editions. Anyone knows how to fix this problem?

[Kobo Glo HD Start Up Loops back to Set up](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/31/2020 1:59:48 AM 

E-reader began to fail without notice by asking for wifi credentials then showing it was attempting to sync as part of set up through the e-reader was fully functional. It then displays a message "Something went wrong...please try again". It repeats this process each time we turn it on and treat the wifi login.   
 I have done the hard re-boot by inserting the pin. I connected it to my computer - it shows it linking and uploading the books and dictionaries. When complete, i try again but the process is still the same - start up process and the indefatigable message something went wrong. No resources on-line have proven to be of any assistance.
