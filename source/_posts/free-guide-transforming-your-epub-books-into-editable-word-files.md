EPUB is a free and open standard format on the market, it's supported by various platforms and devices. Now it has got widely loyal users. But the fact that EPUB file cannot be edited directly, if we do have the demand to edit the content, how can we achieve that? Many users may have thought about converting EPUB to word, and then edit the word doc or docx files. But how to? In this article, I will introduce a free and easy way to help you convert EPUB to word freely. Here are the details.

###  Get the Tool ready

How to convert EPUB to Docx? In order to convert the format perfectly, there is no doubt that we need another tool to help us. Here I strongly recommend you a free and powerful software [Epubor Wordmate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ebook-editor/), with this tool, we can easily convert EPUB to word, edit the content, cover or author information of the EPUB files. At the same time, it's also a good tool for us to create EPUB, Mobi or AZW files. We can even use it as free eBook reading software. 

Things you must know before getting this tool:

**Tips:**

1\. Epubor Wordmate is not an independent program, in fact, it's a plugin for Microsoft word.  
2\. Make sure you have installed Microsoft word on your computer.  
 3\. The plugin works for Microsoft word 2007, 2010, 2013, Microsoft word 2003 or previous version are not supported.   
 4\. It only has win version, not support Mac.

### Convert EPUB to Doc/Docx

Now that the plugin has got ready, it's time to convert EPUB to Doc with it. It's easy to handle.

That's all I want to share with you. Hope this can work for you. By the way, the one thing I have to point out is the plugin can only import DRM free Kindle or EPUB eBooks, if you need to convert DRM protected eBooks, you can use the all-in-one software[Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/), which can help you convert both DRM free and DRM protected eBooks formats.
