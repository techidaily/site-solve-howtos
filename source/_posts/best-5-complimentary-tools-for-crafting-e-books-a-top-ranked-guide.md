### 2\. Calibre

[Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) is a free and open-source e-book computer software application suite which is available for Windows, Linux, and iOS, allows users to manage e-book collections as well as to create, edit, and read e-books. This eBook creator has almost all the advanced features that you need to make your own eBook.

### 3\. Sigil 

[Sigil](https://sigil-ebook.com/) is a free, open-source application that will allow you to import and edit ebooks in .TXT, .HTML and .EPUB format, and only convert them to .EPUB format for export. Sigil has a number of nice functions that make editing much easier, like exploit audio, video, images within your eBook and tweak words by superscript, subscript, strikethrough, tables, lists, hyperlinks etc. Although there are ebook editors out there with more functions, not all of them are this pleasant to use. If you are happy with a basic range of features for your epub editor, Sigil is the one for you. But we have to admit that Sigil's only disadvantage is that it can't support many formats.

Not really a waste of time, the reviews are good and did make me aware of these ePub creators. I used to have one that worked on my PC, most of these new ones all work from a website. I’m still looking for the one I used to have on my PC, it could accept word or pages docs and spat out several different ePub variations. But I can’t find it again, forgot what it was called even. Thanks for adding the links.
