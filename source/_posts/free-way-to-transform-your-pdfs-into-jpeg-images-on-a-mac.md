PDF is a pretty popular file format in the world, but it still requires some PDF viewer programs to open and read it. On Apple Mac OS X, we can use the built-in app Preview to read a PDF file, but on Microsoft Windows, we must install extra software like Adobe Reader or Foxit Reader to open it.

But the image format JPG/JPEG is supported by almost all the smart devices. And many PDF files are scanned images in actual, therefore, conver PDF to JPG/JPEG is thus logical, it won't affect the quality, and the converted image files are more widely supported.

By reading this article, you can learn a free way to convert PDF to JPG/JPEG on mac by using the preset app Preview, then view the images on any device you like.

If you are a Windows PC user, please use our [PDF to JPG Converter for Windows](http://download.epubor.com/pdf2jpg.exe).

### Use Preview to convert PDF to JPG/JPEG for free

Preview is the default PDF and image viewer app in Mac OS X, many people might ignore this app or think it is just for viewing images. In fact, it is also able to handle some file format conversion jobs.

And in this case, we also need another app, iPhoto. It costs $14.99 from App Store, but I've stated pretty clearly in the beginning that this method is going to be free, so I won't make you spent any coin on it.

The customers who bought a Mac device after 2013.10 can get it for free in OS X 10.9 Mavericks, and for the other people, you also can get the iWork suit for free. I wrote a [post on our blog](http://ebookconverter.blogspot.com/2013/11/how-to-get-iwork-suits-for-free-on-old.html) months ago to introduce the trick to get iWork suit for free even you are not qualified for that, and don't worry about the copyright issue, Apple said:"Enjoy it."

Now the preparations are done, let's rock.

1 Open the PDF by Preview app.

2 Click the "File" menu and choose "Print" option in the bottom of the list.

3 Select "Save PDF to iPhoto" option in the "PDF" drop-down list, then the Preview app will convert each page of the PDF to JPEG image, you can also choose the range you want to convert.

I really like your pdf2jpg program. I've signed up for the trial version for Windows and have converted two pdg's (the same file, unfortunately). I saved them to a specific folder but they don't appear there. The message says "conversion complete" but they're not there. Also, where can I find info about the program: features, cost, etc.
