### Situation 1: Remove books from Nook but archive

If your device is the first Nook edition, you should do this online website. But if your devices are Nook 2 Edition\~, you can do this directly on your devices, including Nook eReaders and Nook for Android and IOS app.

1Find "My Nook Library".

You should firstly log into your Barnes&Noble account. Then click "My account" in the top right menu. Find "My Nook Library" and select that.

2Choose the book you want to delete.

In the library you will see all your books are listed clearly. Press and hold on the book cover, a menu that offers several options will pop up. Tap **"Archive"**, then these selected books will disappear from the library. But don't worry they remain on a shelf called "Archived".

For this way you just remove your nook content from your device but the e-books remain in your B&N account and can be redownloaded at no charge.

### Situation 2: Delete books from Nook completely

This situation only applies for removing books purchased from Barnes&Noble.

I want to stress you do not begin this part at random unless you're sure you no longer want to read these books. Because the deletion is permanent and deleted books will have to be re-bought if you want them back or recover.

Nearly the same as the steps at part 1, find your nook books you want to fullly delete, then from the pop-up options touch the "Delete" button. It will prompts you to comfirm the deletion.

**Tips:** 

1\. For deleting books from N1E, you'd better delete them from the account area of the web site.

2\. Whatever you do on your device, don't forget to touch "Check for new B&N content" to **sync** your NOOK to your account after deleting some books.

When I purchased my first Nook book it was easy and simple to delete a book byjust holding down on any book when finished reading and pressing delete. Why have they made it impossible to do so easily??? Will NEVER put

In the Nook app, you can only archive and unarchive your nook books. If you want to delelet your Nook books permanently, you may need to visit your nook account and then manage your nook books there.
