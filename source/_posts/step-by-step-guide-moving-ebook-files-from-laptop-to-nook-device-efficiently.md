**Question**: I downloaded several ebooks onto my computer and now I do not know how to put them onto my Nook Tablet.

There are three programs we teach you how to use. They are all free: **Calibre**, **Adobe Digital Editions** and **Windows Explorer**.

Before transferring your downloaded eBooks from computer to a Nook tablet, first make sure that the prepared **[eBooks are DRM free ePub or PDF format](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/)**(compatible with Nook).

### Method 1: Windows Explorer

1 Connect your Nook to the computer with its USB cable.

2 Open "My Computer", choose "Removable Disk", open the "My Document" folder.

3 Drag the e-book from computer hard drive, and drop it in the "My Documents" folder in the Nook drive folder.

4 Un-plug the USB cable, Turn on your Nook, find the book in the "My Documents" folder. Or you can also do a search job for the book title.

### Method 2: Calibre

**Calibre** is a free software and supports for almost all the major e-readers and tablets on the market. We give you an overview of what the program is all about and how to make simple edits to your book and then transfer it to your Nook Tablet.

1 Download and install Calibre, and then launch Calibre.

2 Click the "Add books" and browse the directory to which you downloaded your eBook files (EPUB and/or PDF). The files will appear in list view in the main window (Library).

3 Connect your eReader device to your PC via USB cable.

4 To transfer the new files to your eReader, highlight the files you wish to have on your eReader and click the "Send to device" button at the top of the window and select your device.

### Method 3: Adobe Digital Editions (read protected books on Nook)

**Adobe Digital Editions** is a program primarily used for managing eBooks and transferring ebooks you have purchased from ePub eBookStores to your device. You also have the ability to copy over books you have borrowed from the library.  
What's more, even if your book has DRM protection, you can use this program to transfer the book to your Nook Tablet. We show you how to transfer book to Nook by Adobe Digital Editions.

![transfer book to nook via ade](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/transfer-to-nook-via-ade.png)

Step 1 Click on the Library View within Adobe Digital Editions. Titles you have downloaded are listed on the right blank.

Step 2 You will see the file copied to the nook. The title is now transferred to the device. On a PC, click “Safely Remove Hardware” icon on the lower right of your monitor. Then click the “Safely Remove USB Mass Storage Device” box.

Step 3 Touch the menu icon at the bottom of your nook for My Library. The book you just downloaded will appear under “My Documents.” Scroll down to the title. Touch “View item details and options.” Touch “Read” to begin reading your eBook.

eBooks can't be downloaded directly from the OverDrive page to your nook. To transfer downloaded eBook from computer to NOOK, you need to make sure the eBooks format can be supported by NOOK. NOOK supports TXT, PDF, Word, and ePub formats. If your eBooks are none of these formats, you need to convert them to NOOK supported format.

If the book's format you want to transfer is not supported by Nook Tablet, and it is DRM protected, such as a Kindle Amazon book, you need a **one-stop eBook solution**, [Epubor Ultimate which can convert DRM protected book](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/)to Nook Tablet format **within one click**.

If you only have the SD Card, then please find a card reader, and plug the card reader to computer and do the job as solution A.

I realize this article is almost two years old. And in truth, I have an older Nook Color and the directions work flawlessly. However, I just bought a Nook HD10 and I'm stumped. I have a Calibre library on my PC with hundreds of EPUB books in it. They work fine in The Aldiko app on Android, Marvin on iOS, and on Calibre, of course. And when I convert them to MOBI they work find on a Kindle. But there seems no way to import the entire library into the Nook HD10\. I've tried google and I've tried exchanging LONG strings of email with Barnes & Noble and nothing that gets suggested or read works. There's no My Documents, Documents or My Files folders on the Nook. I can create these folders and copy the books into them. And then I can start the "files" app on the Nook and navigate to the books and start reading them and they get imported. But I have to do that one book at a time. And with a library of many hundreds of books that's just not an acceptable solution. And ideas?

 Very well written HOWTO by the way.

Calibre has a developed a major flaw in the last six months that they haven't issued a fix for. With their recent updates Calibre stopped being able to communicate with a large number of devices. It impacts multiple brands of eReaders and may have to do with tablets that have SD cards installed for extra storage. None of the reviewers are talking about this huge flaw and there also doesn't seem to be any talk about the lack of eReader software that works with your computer library to send your changes and edits to a tablet. I rename certain series by a code to make sorting easier. For the Inspector Gamache series by Louise Penny I use IG01, IG02 etc before the title of each book so I can read the books in order. However, when I export my books from Alfa Pro to my tablet none of those changes are saved. It used to work with Calibre but since this new flaw there don't seem to be any ebook managers that will send your saved changes when exporting books.

Some of the epub books that I download from the library show up in the ADE library, appear to be copied over to the Nook, but do not show up on the Nook. When I look at the Nook library through ADE, those books appear. When I look in Downloaded files on the computer, the file is there. When I look at the Nook through Explorer, the files are there. but when the Nook is disconnected from the computer, and I look at My Files in the Library, nothing. Those books aren't there.  
 This does not happen with all epub books from the library, only some. What might be going on? Thanks.
