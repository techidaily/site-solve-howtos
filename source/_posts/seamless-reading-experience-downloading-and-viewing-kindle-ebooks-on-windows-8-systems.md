More and more people have moved to the camp of Windows 8 nowadays partly due to its chic combination of traditional PC interface and Touchscreen-oriented tile style.

As to eBook reading, what should we do when we want to read Amazon Kindle books on Windows 8? This is what will be discussed in this article.

**Note:** If you are using any other Windows system, here are three methods to [read Kindle books on PC](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

Your article doesn't address how to use kindle on the PC not in the Metro mode. 

 Nor how to download a PC kindle when using one's laptop on a local account (not a Microsoft account). It doesn't seem to be merely a question of logging into one's Microsoft account, but one has to convert one's laptop account to a Microsoft account ... which many of us are not happy doing. Even if we do ... does kindle still work if we convert back to a local account.

This doesn't tell me how to get in and out of the reader. I am a reading a book and I want to get out of it and start reading another. Opening the Kindle app just takes me back to the book. Help.

I use the Kindle app on my Microsoft Surface 3\. I'd like to change the default dictionary to German-English (tap on a word in German and bring up the English translation). Is there a way to do this? I'm trying to read German novels.  
 Thank you!

The Kindle for Win8 app is a crippled app.

 #1 It does not support collections. So all you have is a single pool of books, with no way to organize them. You only have by title or by author. There is no way to organize by subject, which is what the collections could do. This is fine if you only have a few books on your device. But once you get over a few dozen books, or even trying to look at the hundreds or thousands of books in your cloud, for get it, again, one single large pool with no way to sift through it by subject/collection. It is the old library card catalog but with only an author and title sort, no subject sort.

 #2 The Kindle for Win8 will periodically "call home to Amazon" requiring you to log into your Amazon account. The problem with this is, Amazon neglected to understand that many of us use the Win8 app on a tablet. And said tablet does not always have internet access, sometimes for days. What that means is, when the app decides it wants to "call home to Amazon" and you have no internet access, the program will terminate. At that point, the app is dead, and you CANNOT read your downloaded books. I don't know why the app wants to call home to Amazon, but the failure mode, when it cannot access the internet is unacceptable. You already downloaded the books, yet you now cannot access and read those books, until such time as you can get an internet connection to log in to Amazon. To understand how hard this problem impacts the user, imagine going on a trip where you don't have public wifi access for days, and the app decides to do it's "call home" on day 1.

I am having the same issue... I did have Kindle on my Surface Pro Windows rt8.1 tablet until I had to do a reset - I was able to download the app but couldn't sign in - when I did some searching I found an article somewhere that said that Amazon wasn't going to support this type of app. So when I tried to do the typical download to windows as it suggested, the Tablet is telling me that I have to get the app from the Store - but the app isn't in the store now.  
 If you get an answer, let me know too - this is frustrating!!

Amazon doesn't support anything on Surface RT/2\. The new app only works on PC's, so all the books I have on my kindle can only be read on the Kindle. There is no help available. It is just stupid. They just didn't want to support the two systems. This all happened on October 27, 2016\. I had to reset my surface 2 in 2017 and once that happened, the Kindle for Windows 8 on the surface was unavailable to be re-installed.
